From finished building OpenJDK 6 on OS / X Snowleopard, I wanted to test just to see how he behaved towards the implementation of Apple. I used a development version of MacPorts ([see it trac](https://trac.macports.org/ticket/20956)) that appears very promising and got OpenJDK 1.6.0-b20.

`openjdk version "1.6.0" OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0-b20) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 17.0-b16, mixed mode)`

## A Java application with GUI under OS/X - OpenJDK

First test was to launched a big application like Eclipse under OS/X with OpenJDK. I selected OpenJDK 6 as default VM by adding the properties file in this eclipse.ini _Eclipse.app / Contents / MacOS / eclipse.ini_

`-vm /opt/local/share/java/openjdk6/bin/java`

It worked pretty well :

A big thank you to SWT / Cocoa since there are still problems with AWT and OS / X

## Speed and stability of OpenJDK

My test system is an Apple Mac Book Pro (MacBookPro5,1) with Intel Core 2 Duo 2.66Ghz and 4Gb DDR3 1067Mhz.

### DaCapo Benchmarks

I do some tests with [DaCapo 9.12-bach](http://www.dacapobench.org/), discarding **batik** test, this one requiring a working AWT/Swing support .

Bench tests launched with -n X, ie (java -jar dacapo-9.12-bach.jar -n 10 pmd)

Some tests failed under OpenJDK 6, related on Tomcat / IO but as we can see in next section, Tomcat 6 or 7 worked with OpenJDK.

### IO Benchs with ApacheBench and Tomcat6/7

Then I wanted to see the speed of the JVM under IO load and why I made a little stress test two well-known applications, Tomcat 6 and 7. I used [ApacheBench](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html) to request 1000000 time a simple URI (/examples/servlets/servlet/RequestInfoExample), with 100 concurrents clients.

ApacheBench and Tomcat were on the same machine, to avoid network bottleneck. Activity Monitor show a CPU load of 120% for Java and 20% for ab

Here also OpenJDK 6 perform well even slighty better than Apple own implementation.

## Conclusion

OpenJDK 6 appears very promising and Appleâ€™s decision to suspend the maintenance of Java on its next OS / X will not be so bad.

Hoping now that porting AWT / Swing and Cocoa to appear quickly in the Project OpenJDK / BSD
