At first, my blog was hosted on WordPress.

There were so many attack attempts on the WordPress-powered sites I worked on that I decided to move to something simpler, [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).

Incidentally, Octopress reached End of Life in 2015, so I had to move to something else. I chose [HubPress](https://github.com/HubPress), which unfortunately stopped development in 2019.

For a few years, my blog was waiting for a new engine. Then came [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a well-supported engine with a lot of plugins and themes. Additionally, Hugo integrates very simply with GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.
## Install Hugo

I installed Hugo using the [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/)

```
asdf plugin add hugo
asdf install hugo latest
asdf global hugo latest
```

Then I installed extended hugo

```
hugo version

hugo v0.128.0-e6d2712ee062321dc2fc49e963597dd5a6157660+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=2024-06-25T16:15:48Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
```

Hugo being 0.128.0, install same extended version with asdf

```
asdf install hugo extended_0.128.0
asdf global hugo extended_0.128.0
```

## Blog Theme - PaperMode

There are a **really large number** of themes available for Hugo. I decided to choose something simple, [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod).

I tried the latest released version, 7.0 (February 2023), but it didn't work as expected. So, I switched to the latest version in the master branch (something I always try to avoid).
 
```
mkdir Documents/Perso
hugo new site blog.hgomez.net
cd blog.hgomez.net
git init

#Â Grab latest PaperMod (get master as latest release 7.0 didn't works as expected)
curl -L https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/archive/master.zip -Os
cd themes
unzip ../master.zip
mv hugo-PaperMod-master/ PaperMod
cd ..
# Housekeeping :)
rm -f master.zip
rm -f hugo.toml 
touch hugo.yaml
```

Default configuration, in hugo.yaml file
```title=hugo.yaml
baseURL: https://blog.hgomez.net/
languageCode: en-us
