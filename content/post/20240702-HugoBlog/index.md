A first, my blog was hosted on Wordpress.

There was so many attacks attempts on the wordpress powered sites I worked on that, I deviced to move to something simple, [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).

Octopress incidently turned End Of Life in 2015, so I had to move to something else, [Hubpress](https://github.com/HubPress) who was stopped in 2019.

And for a few years, blog was waiting for a new engine, here enter [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a well-supported engine, with a lot of plugins and themes, and whereGitHub Pages integration is very simple via GitHub Action.  

## Install Hugo

I installed Hugo using the [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/)

```
asdf plugin add hugo
asdf install hugo latest
asdf global hugo latest
```

Then I installed extended hugo

```
hugo version

hugo v0.128.0-e6d2712ee062321dc2fc49e963597dd5a6157660+extended linux/amd64 BuildDate=2024-06-25T16:15:48Z VendorInfo=gohugoio
```

Hugo being 0.128.0, install same extended version with asdf

```
asdf install hugo extended_0.128.0
asdf global hugo extended_0.128.0
```

## Blog Theme - PaperMode

There is really a lot of themes with Hugo, I decided to go with something simple, [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod)
I tried the latest released version, 7.0, Feb 2023, but it didn't worked as expected, so I moved to the latest version in master (something I always try to avoid)
  

```
mkdir Documents/Perso
hugo new site blog.hgomez.net
cd blog.hgomez.net
git init

#Â Grab latest PaperMod (get master as latest release 7.0 didn't works as expected)
curl -L https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/archive/master.zip -Os
cd themes
unzip ../master.zip
mv hugo-PaperMod-master/ PaperMod
cd ..
# Housekeeping :)
rm -f master.zip
rm -f hugo.toml 
```
