It was an honor to be chosen as a speaker at the Voxxed Luxembourg 2024 conference. I'm thrilled to share my passion for SRE, specifically addressing the common misconceptions and the true nature of this crucial role in our industry.

To resume :

- SREs are not superheroes.
- Your company is not Google, so manage SRE accordingly.
- It's crucial to involve all stakeholders.
- Observability is a key to success.
