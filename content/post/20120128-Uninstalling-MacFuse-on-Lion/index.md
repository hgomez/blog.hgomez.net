If you installed MacFuse on Lion (10.7) and tried to uninstall you may encountered the following error :

```
sudo /Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/Support/uninstall-macfuse-core.sh
MacFUSE Uninstaller: Can not find the Archive.bom for MacFUSE Core package.
```

Uninstaller didnâ€™t check for Lion (uname -r reporting 11.x). So fix is easy, just edit uninstaller script **/Library/Filesystems/fusefs.fs/Support/uninstall-macfuse-core.sh** and add 11_) in case next to 10_)

```
...

OS_RELEASE=`/usr/bin/uname -r`
case "$OS_RELEASE" in
  8*)
    log "Incorrect uninstall. Use the Tiger version please."
    exit 1
    ;;
