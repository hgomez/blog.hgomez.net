I've been using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for several months now to take my notes. It's an easy-to-use tool for writing in markdown mode, and it's very simple to insert images or links.

Obsidian organizes documentation into [Vaults](https://help.obsidian.md/Getting+started/Create+a+vault), which are simply folders. This makes it very easy to have the said content in a Git repository and thus have your notes shared on multiple devices, which is very practical when you want to switch from a personal computer to a professional one.

There is paid plans on Obsidian to [sync contents](https://obsidian.md/sync) on your devices and even [publish to the web](https://obsidian.md/publish) but this is not something I'm using right now, using git is enough for me.

[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a blog engine using Markdown, there was obviously something to do to get blog contents produced via Obsidian.

It was quite simple.

1. I created a blog part inside Obsidian vault 
2. I copied old blogs contents by copy/pasting text and images.
3. One article is a directory, using my own convention YYYYMMDD-Title 
4. Inside the folder, an **index.md** and extra contents like images

Obsidian create a titlte.md file, so your title will be **index** and you enter the blog metadata contents as expected by Hugo

That's all, your document have the structure expected by Hugo.
You can edit your file and when done, copy it to your Hugo directory.

For example :

* Obsidian blog contents is hosted under `$HOME/Documents/Perso/Blog/blog.hgomez.net`
* Hugo blog is hosted under `$HOME/Documents/Perso/blog.hgomez.net`

I only have to copy Obsidian blog contents under `content/post` directory in Hugo

```
cp -rf ~/Documents/Perso/obsidian-hgomez/Blog/blog.hgomez.net/* ~/Documents/Perso/blog.hgomez.net/content/post/
```

With this structure, you have a working copy of your blog in Obsidian with Hugo hosting elsewhere, your Obsidian and Hugo are totaly separated and can have their own lifecycle.

âš  Hugo won't produce pages where date is set in the future, when editing your date in blog post, be sure to have something set in the past ðŸ˜‡
