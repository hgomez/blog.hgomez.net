My former blog was hosted on GitHub Pages and it was really easy to use Hugo there.



There were so many attack attempts on the WordPress-powered sites I worked on that I decided to move to something simpler, [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).

Incidentally, Octopress reached End of Life in 2015, so I had to move to something else. I chose [HubPress](https://github.com/HubPress), which unfortunately stopped development in 2019.

For a few years, my blog was waiting for a new engine. Then came [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a well-supported engine with a lot of plugins and themes. Additionally, Hugo integrates very simply with GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions
